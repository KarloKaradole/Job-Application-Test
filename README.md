# Job Application - Python Developer

This repository contains my solutions to seven technical tasks that I completed as part of the job interview process for the Python Developer position at **ENT**.

Each task is designed to test my proficiency in Python, problem-solving skills, and ability to implement efficient and clean code across various scenarios including algorithms, data manipulation, and SQL queries.

## Task Descriptions:

- **Task 1: Date Formatter**
  - Implement an algorithm that takes several raw dates in random formats and converts them into a standardized date format.

- **Task 2: Custom Logarithmic Function**
  - Extend the Python `math` library by creating a custom logarithmic function that can handle additional cases not covered by the built-in `log` function.

- **Task 3: Hospital Patient Data Collection**
  - Develop a system to collect and organize data about hospital patients, ensuring that the information is structured and easily accessible for medical staff.

- **Task 4: Combo Counter for Computer Game**
  - Create an algorithm to track and count how many combo moves a player achieves in a computer game, with a focus on real-time performance and accuracy.

- **Task 5: SQL Query - Author Selection**
  - Write a SQL query to find all authors who meet specific conditions from a database, demonstrating the ability to filter and retrieve relevant data efficiently.

- **Task 6: SQL Table Modification**
  - Modify an existing SQL table by adding new columns, adjusting the structure of the employee database to meet updated business requirements.

- **Task 7: XML Navigator**
  - Design an algorithm to clean up and simplify "rough" XML files, providing users with a more organized and readable version of the data.

## Key Skills Demonstrated:
- **Python 3.x**: Algorithm design, custom library functions.
- **Data structures**: Efficient handling of structured data like dates, patient records, and XML.
- **SQL**: Querying and modifying relational databases.
- **Algorithms**: Real-time event counting (game combos), date formatting, XML parsing.
- **File handling**: XML file parsing and cleanup.
- **Problem-solving**: Breaking down complex problems into clear, efficient solutions.

Feel free to explore each solution and see how I approached solving the challenges. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
