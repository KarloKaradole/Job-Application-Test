Task Description:
You are provided with a list of date strings in various formats. Your task is to write a function that standardizes these dates into a specific format: YYYYDDMM (where YYYY is the year, DD is the day, and MM is the month).

The input list may contain dates in different formats, including:

Standard formats like YYYY/MM/DD or MM-DD-YYYY.
Custom format: Some dates may be in the format YYYYp DDp MM, where 'p' is a literal character separating the year, day, and month, and there may be additional spaces.
Other formats such as continuous strings without separators (e.g., YYYYMMDD).

Your function should:

Handle multiple date formats by trying to match them and convert them to the required YYYYDDMM format.
Identify the custom format YYYYp DDp MM and handle it appropriately.
If the format of a date string doesn't match any of the known patterns, skip or ignore that date without throwing an error.

Example Input:

dates = ["2010/02/20", "2 016p 19p 12", "11-18-2012", "2018 12 24", "20130720"]

Example Output:

["20102002", "20161912", "20121811", "20182412", "20132007"]
