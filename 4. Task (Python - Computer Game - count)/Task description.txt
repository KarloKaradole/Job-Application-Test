A computer gaame allows players to perform special actions using the key combinations "QEE" or "ZCC".
A player gets extra points if they use these combinations equally in a gaming session.
Skilled players who don't use any of the special actions also get extra points.
Complete the function match_key_combo, which returns True if the number of occurences of "QEE" matches the number of occurrences of "ZCC" in a sequence of keypresses recieved from player,
or if both key combinations have an occurrence of 0. Otherwise it should return False.
String comparison should be case insensitive. 

Starting code looks like:

def match_key_combo(sequence):

    return None

print(match_key_combo("QEEAZCC"))
print(match_key_combo("QEEQEEZCCZCC"))
print(match_key_combo("QEEZCCQEE"))
print(match_key_combo("XYZ"))

Example output: 

    match_key_combo("QEEAZCC") → True (one "QEE" and one "ZCC")

    match_key_combo("QEEQEEZCCZCC") → True (two "QEE" and two "ZCC")

    match_key_combo("QEEZCCQEE") → False (two "QEE" but one "ZCC")

    match_key_combo("XYZ") → True (no "QEE" or "ZCC")
